        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: May 31, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Fundamental Stock Analysis ("we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at <a href="https://fundamentalstockanalysis.vercel.app/">https://fundamentalstockanalysis.vercel.app/</a> ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Fundamental Stock Analysis) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

        <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>

        <h2>Types of cookies we use:</h2>

        <h3>Essential Website Cookies:</h3>
        <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Website functions.</p>

        <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</h3>
        <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> We embed videos from our official YouTube channel. YouTube uses cookies to collect data on video views, user preferences, and to serve targeted advertising. These are third-party cookies governed by Google's policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> We use Google Fonts to display text on our website. Google Fonts may set cookies or log IP addresses for usage statistics and to protect against malicious activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</h3>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our hosting provider (Vercel) may collect anonymous analytics data.</li>
            <li>If we implement tools like Google Analytics in the future, this section will be updated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in your web browser. Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>
