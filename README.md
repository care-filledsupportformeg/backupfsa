## Asset Management Guidelines

### Adding New Images

1. Place all content images in the `assets/images/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames with kebab-case (e.g., `tsmc-analysis-chart.jpg`)
3. Optimize images before adding them to the repository:
   - Compress JPG/PNG files using tools like TinyPNG
   - Consider using WebP format for better compression
   - Keep image dimensions appropriate for their use case
4. Always include proper alt text in HTML for accessibility

### Adding New Icons

1. Place all icons in the `assets/icons/` directory
2. Use SVG format when possible for better scaling

4. Follow the naming convention: `feature-name.svg` or `feature-name.png`

### Logo Guidelines

1. Place all logos in the `assets/logos/` directory
2. Include multiple sizes if needed (e.g., `logo-small.png`, `logo-large.png`)
3. Include favicon and touch icons for better device integration

### CSS/JS Management

1. Keep the main CSS in `css/styles.css`
